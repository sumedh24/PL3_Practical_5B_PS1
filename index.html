        <h1  >“What is blockchain"</h1>
        <address>A blockchain is a distributed ledger that is completely open to any and everyone on the network. Once an information is stored on a blockchain, it is extremely difficult to change or alter it. Each transaction on a blockchain is secured with a digital signature that proves its authenticity</address>

    <article style="text-align: justify; font-size: 21px;">Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.

        A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participant’s ledger. The decentralised database managed by multiple participants is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).
        
        Blockchain is a type of DLT in which transactions are recorded with an immutable cryptographic signature called a hash.</article>

        <article style="text-align: justify;font-size: larger;">Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) that stores data (commonly immutable and sequenced transaction records) in a decentralized manner via encryption and consensus algorithms. 1 The first widely recognized implementation of blockchain was in 2009 with the Bitcoin public blockchain.The information available to
            all network participants is a shared ledger of all information transactions on the blockchain. The consensus
            algorithms ensure that information is consistent and immutable across this decentralized network and deter
            individual users from adding to ledger information without authorization from the network.
